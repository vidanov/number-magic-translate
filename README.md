A powerful web application that helps you convert numbers into memorable words using the Major System mnemonic technique. This tool is perfect for memory athletes, students, and anyone who wants to improve their number memorization skills.

## How It Works

The Major System is a mnemonic technique that converts numbers into consonant sounds, which can then be combined with vowels to form memorable words. For example:

- The number "1" might be represented by the sound "t" or "d"
- The number "2" might be represented by the sound "n"
- The number "3" might be represented by the sound "m"

By combining these sounds with vowels, we create memorable words that represent numbers. This makes it much easier to remember long sequences of numbers.
